Mangroves are multi-purpose trees and shrubs that develop adaptation mechanisms allowing them to survive in saline water. They provide many ecosystems service to coastal communities all over the world. Evidences have shown that the coverage of these special type of forests have recently been increasing in some areas while decreasing in others. Here, we used time series of remotely-sensed data from Landsat and MODIS to study the dynamics of mangroves vegetation in The Gambia and Ghana.
